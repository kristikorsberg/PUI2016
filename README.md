# PUI2016

The tasks associated with Homework One are itemized below. I describe what I did to personally
contribute, and explain who I worked with.

1. I submitted my github account name on NYUClasses and read 'What is the Question?'
2. The lab from class introduced me to github, and the repository sharing that can be achieved
between my local machine, my remote profile on Compute, my github online repository, and my
classmates' online repositories. 
3. In class, I created a repo in Compute called 'gittest_kkorsberg' and added 'myfirstfile.txt'.
I pushed this to github online, which didn't work initially because I didn't have an online respository
created. After making PUI2016_kk3374, I pushed the existing repository from the command line. I added
the git origin <https://github.com/kristikorsberg/gittest_kkorsberg>. I then made changes to the file
from my Compute profile committed and pushed them to the online repo. I practiced the process of editing 
'myfirstfile.txt' on the Compute machine and the online repo several different times, which can be seen 
in lines 3-11.
4. I attended Sabreen's Office Hours on Thursday, September 8. Initially I was there to review environmental
variables (more on that below), but I ended up working with Danny, Victor, and Yuan on github forking. I
forked Danny's gittest file. On September 9, I also forked Shay's 'myfirstfile.txt' file insider her
gittest repository. Shay successfully merged my edits to her file. Danny hasn't done so yet. 
Having not used github before, I sought help from Sabreen, who helped with identifying which file
paths to copy into the 'git clone' command. 
5. On September 9, I received a pull request from Shay because she made edits to my 'myfirstfile.txt' file.
I merged these edits with my master file, which can be seen on my gittest_kkorsberg 'myfirstfile.txt'. 
6. On September 8, I read Ryan Chadwick's bash tutorial in order to set environment variables. I created
two variables in my /.bash_profile, however I did not complete the task because I wasn't sure where to
save the alias. I also didn't know I had to 'source /.bash_profile' to make the system acknowledge the new
lines inside the file. The following day, I attended Sabreen's office hours to get some guidance about what
to do. Ultimately, Himanshu arrived and explained to the group (Victor, Yuan, Danny, and myself) what
environment variables are and why they are saved inside the .bash_profile. With that information, we created
new variables and an alias inside our .bash_profile files. Himanshu then told us that to complete the process
we had to 'source /.bash_profile' in the terminal. I created the variable and alias for pui2016 on my 
local machine. Himanshu guided us through the process. 
7. On September 9, using the process that Himanshu explained the day prior, I created environment 
variables on Compute. Screenshots are here:
