1. This is the README.md file which will store all the information pertaining to the first homework assignment in Principles of Urban Informatics. This message was created on my local machine.
2. This is an edit from the github repository online, which I will pull down onto my computer.
3. This is the final edit I will make on the local machine before answering the homework questions. I've typed this in a text editor, as opposed to the terminal.
