Hi Anastasia, I really like your plot, visually depicting the mean math scores on New York state tests for students
in grades 3 thorugh 8. I think that differentiating the grades by colors in the scatter plot by is an incredibly useful visual aid, 
however adding a legend would be helpful so that it is clear which colors are associated with which grades. 

Since the title of the plot 'Mean Math Scores for Students Grades 3-8', I assumed that I would see one plot per grade 
corresponding to the grade's average, however there are many, so it's a little confusing. Given the dataframe, it looks like 
the different plots per grade are associated with the mean math scores by race, however, race is not an element included in
the plot title or in the x axis label. Perhaps incorporating the racial componenet of the data would make the plot more clear.
I'm not sure how it would all fit in one graph, but it might be interesting to show the change of mean math scores by race
over time. One example of this would be to create five different graphs, one per year and plot the mean math scores by race
for one year at a time and then compare them. Last, and I'm not sure if this is the case, but the scatter plot wouldn't show
if more than one racial group had the same mean score, so a histogram may be an interesting way to depict the distribution of 
different scores as well. I do think the plot is honestly reproducing the data, it is just leaving out the element of race.
