Hi Achilles, your plots are extremely easy to understand. Great visuals! For the first one, 'Plotting of the Total Time-Zones
in America for Randomized Data', the font sizes, color scheme, axis labels, and title give the viewer a great summary of 
what you're plotting. While the legend is nice, I don't think it's necessary because you are only plotting the one data type.
I also like the background grid you decided to include because I can easily quantify the time zone counts. My only real
piece of feedback here is that I am not quite sure what it is you are counting. I know the assignment was to plot anything 
you want, so this count is fine, just something to think about for the future.

The 3D plot of randomly generated data is also easy to read.
