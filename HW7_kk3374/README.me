For this assignment, we were asked to create a plot of our choice. I wanted to take the opportunity, in addition to developing my plotting skills, to familiarize myself with some Pandas data wrangling that I hadn't yet worked on. I selected a dataset from NYC Open Data, which captured natural energy consumption for all NYC zip codes in the year 2010. I created a dictionary of zip code keys and borough value names and mapped the zip codes to the borough. I then plotted the average use of natural energy consumption by zip code. I made sure to include a chart title, axis labels, and a caption.
