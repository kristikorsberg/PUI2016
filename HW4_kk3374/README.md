This is the README.md file for PUI HW4

1. I completed the reading entitled 'Estimating the Reproducibility of Social Sciences"

2. I reviewed Hrafnkell Hjorleifsson's Citi Bike repo, and determined that he should use a one-tailed t-test to evaluate 
the difference in means between weekday ridership and weekend day ridership. I emailed Federica to ensure that I understood
the one-tailed and two-tailed t-test so that I could provide him with the most accurate recommendation. My CitibikeReview_kk3374.md file can be found in his HW4 PUI repository. 

3. I chose to evaluate a chi squared study and a linear regression study, which were representative of statistical tests
that identify a difference in means and those which assess the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

Statistical Analysis - Chi Squared
Independent Variable(s)	- month of birth
IV Type(s) - categorical
Dependent Variable(s)	- age at death
DV Type(s) - continuous
Control Variable(s)- education and gender
Control Variable Type(s) - categorical
Question to be Answered	- does month of birth impact risk of death?
H0 - age of death for individuals born Jan - March, April - June, July - September, and October - December have the same
risk of death as those individuals born in the month of November

*It seems like the study use the expected death rates of individuals born in November and compared them to the death rates
of every other month, broken out by quarter. 

KK article summary - assess the prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors among the native indigenous of
a Brazilian village. Cross-sectional, population based analysis was conducted with adults ages 18+. Multivariate regression
was conducted on the socio-demographic and clinical independent variables. The prevalence of hypertension was not significantly
different between genders. Hypertension was more common among obese, diabetic, and older patients as well as those who 
consumed alcohol, had a lower educational level, or had a family history of hypertension. There was no association between
hypertension and tobacco smoking or family income. Hypertension in this village was similar to the prevalence in the 
entire Brazilian population, but may have had a more negative effect on the disadvantage population. Study was created because
indigenous populations worldwide exhibit a lower life expectancy and poorer health status in comparison to non-indigenous
populations. There are many similar determinants for poor health, such as inadequate or inefficient health care services and
poor living conditions. Objective of study was to assess prevalence of hypertension among adults in Jaguapiru and the
relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and socioeconomic factors and known cardio-metabolic risk factors. Study
was conducted from 2009-2011. Pregnant women were not eligible because it affects blood pressure. Participants were 
interviewed about SES, dietary habits, physical activity, self-reported use of alcohol and tobacco, age, gender, 
occupation, personal and family history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, educational level, and health conditions.
Qualitative variables are presented as absolute (n) and relative(%) frequencies and the quantiative variables are presented
as means and standard deviations. A univariate regression was applied to all SES and clinical variables, which allowed the
researchers to narrow the multivariate regression to those variables with p-values <.25. Smoking and family income didn't
exhibit an association with arterial hypertension. The prevalence of arterial hypertension found in this study is about 22.7%,
which is similar to the 20% reported on prevalence in the entire country of Brazil. 
Statistical Analysis - multivariate / multiple regression
Independent Variable(s)	- age, obesity, alcoholism, family history of hypertension, and diabetes
IV Type(s) - discrete, discrete, categorical, categorical, and categorical
Dependent Variable(s)	- hypertension
DV Type(s) - discrete
Control Variable(s)
Control Variable Type(s)	
Question to be Answered	- which socio-demographic and clinical characteristics contribute to the prevalence of hypertension
in the Brazilian village of Jaguapiru.
H0	- socio-demographic and clinical attributes do not affect the prevalence of hypertension amont adults in the indigenous
village of Jaguapiru, Brazil
