This is the README.md file for PUI HW4

1. I completed the reading entitled 'Estimating the Reproducibility of Social Sciences"

2. I reviewed Hrafnkell Hjorleifsson's Citi Bike repo, and determined that he should use a one-tailed t-test to evaluate 
the difference in means between weekday ridership and weekend day ridership. I emailed Federica to ensure that I understood
the one-tailed and two-tailed t-test so that I could provide him with the most accurate recommendation. My CitibikeReview_kk3374.md file can be found in his HW4 PUI repository. 

3. I chose to evaluate a chi squared study and a linear regression study, which were representative of statistical tests
that identify a difference in means and those which assess the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The tables are at the bottom of this README.md.

4. For the third assignment, I worked independently to learn about the z test and the chi squared test. In order to find the z and chi squared statistics, I followed Federica's skeleton notebook, read "Introduction to Statistics", and watched several videos through Khan Academy.
